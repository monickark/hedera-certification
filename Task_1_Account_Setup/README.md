# Task 1

## Problem

Create a script to generate 5 Hedera Testnet accounts (Account1,
Account2, Account3, Account4 and Account5).
Use these accounts as indicated in the following tasks.
These accounts must not already exist before the start of the test.

account IDs during your response to the certification test.
Fund the accounts as you see appropriate to cover the costs of
your tasks.
